Bubbless-MAME Data Converter
=============
##What's this?
This will convert data format between Bubbless GX400 bubble memory emulator and MAME.
Since bubble memory's data organization is quite different from ordinary ROMs, there might be various formats to represent the data in a bubble memory.
I made this for the convenience of debugging and research.

##How to use?
Follow the instruction on the console.
